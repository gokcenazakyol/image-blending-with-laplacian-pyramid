# Introduction to Image Blending and Laplacian Pyramid
Image blending[1] is a technique in image processing in which two or more images are combined into a single new image. This can be accomplished in a number of methods, such as by projecting the images on top of one another, combining them using a blending technique, or by merging the pixel data from the images to generate a new image.

The Laplacian pyramid is used to deconstruct the source images into various degrees of detail, and the resulting pyramid representations are then combined to generate a new, blended image. This approach is known as image blending with Laplacian pyramid. The differences between successively smoother versions of an image are encoded in the Laplacian pyramid, a multi-scale representation of the image. A new image that seamlessly and smoothly blends the details from each of the source photos can be produced by mixing the Laplacian pyramid representations of the source images.
